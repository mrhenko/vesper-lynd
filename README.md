Vesper Lynd
===========

*Vesper Lynd* is a web app to track drink (or food) recipes, attach a picture to each and every one of them and, most importantly, add your comments. It is created to scratch an itch that I got when I started trying to make various drinks and cocktails in the summer of 2013.

The app is __not__ meant to be a web service for everyone. Each user is supposed to install her/his own copy on a web server.

Dogma
-----
Apart from scratching my own itch, *Vesper Lynd* is also created as a programming exercise for me so I keep up my game in certain areas and learn a few new thing. To achive this the project has the following goals.

* The backend should be written in PHP and make use of Unit Testing.
* The database part of the backend should be built using PostgreSQL.
* The frontend should have a "native" app feel.
	* It should use vanilla javascript, no libraries or frameworks.
	* HTML AppCache should be used.
* I'm going to make heavy use of *rubberducking*.
	* When coding, each important segment/class should be explained in comments __before__ I actually start writing the code.
